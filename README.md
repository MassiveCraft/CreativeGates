CreativeGates
========

CreativeGates is a plugin that allows you to create teleportation gates **without running a single command.** 
The plugin does not impose design restrictions. **Design the gate frame any way you like.**

###Gate Networks

Gates are connected to the other gates in the same network. The network name is chosen when creating the gate. 
The size, design or what materials you have in the frame does not matter. 
If you have 5 gates in the network “derpingschtein” those gates will link to each other like a snake biting it’s tail.
